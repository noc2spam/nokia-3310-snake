# Snake Game in HTML Canvas

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML Canvas. The game is controlled using arrow keys and the objective is to eat the food and grow the snake without hitting the wall or itself.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will start automatically and you can control the snake using the arrow keys. If the snake hits the wall or itself, an alert message will be displayed and the game will end.

## Customization

You can customize the game further by modifying the following parameters in the JavaScript code:

`cellSize`: The size of each cell in pixels.

`numCells`: The number of cells in the grid.

`snake`: The initial position and length of the snake.

`food`: The initial position of the food.

`loop`: The speed of the game loop in milliseconds.

You can also add sound effects, scoring, and other features to make the game more interesting.
